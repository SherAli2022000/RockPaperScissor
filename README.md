## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure, styling, and JavaScript for the game.

## Game Logic

The JavaScript code is embedded in the `index.html` file (`<script>` tags), and it handles the game logic. It randomly selects the computer's move and compares it with the player's move to determine the winner. The score is updated accordingly.

## Styling

The styling is embedded in the `index.html` file using `<style>` tags. It defines the layout for the game interface, including the title, score display, move selections, and result announcement.
